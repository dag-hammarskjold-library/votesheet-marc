# votesheet-marc
Convert vote result PDF to MARC.

#### Requirements:
The `pdftotext` executable that is part of [Xpdf](https://www.xpdfreader.com/pdftotext-man.html) needs to be in the user's PATH. One way to do this is [download and extract the command line tools](https://www.xpdfreader.com/download.html), find the `pdftotext` exectuable file, and copy it into the directory you are running the script from. Make sure you get the executable for the system you are on (Windows/Mac/Linux). If using Mac or Linux, you will probably have to make the file executable by running `chmod +x pdftotext`.

Windows: 
* [Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/)

Mac/Linux: 
* Built-in Perl installation should be sufficient.

#### Installation:
> `git clone https://github.com/dag-hammarskjold-library/votesheet-marc`

Change directory into the repository.
> `cd votesheet-marc`

Install the dependencies using the `cpanm` Perl package installer (included with Strawberry Perl)
> `cpanm --installdeps .`

#### Usage:

```bash
perl votesheet-marc.pl file1.pdf file2.pdf
```

For each file path provided to the script, the user will be prompted to manually enter the resolution symbol for the vote in the file. The user is able to review the results on the screen, to compare with the data in the PDF if they wish. When all the files have been processed, one MARC file (.mrc or .mrk) is produced containing the MARC data for all the files prcossed as a batch for import.
